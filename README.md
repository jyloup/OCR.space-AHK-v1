# OCR.space-AHK-v1
this snippet extracts text from local image using ahk v1 language.
The code is based on AHK forum topic https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=24884&p=117844
but the provided code gives an error (2025) so i provide a working example with autohotkey v1 language.
The extracted text displays on msgbox.
